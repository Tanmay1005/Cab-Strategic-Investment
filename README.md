# Cab Strategic Investment
XYZ, a private investment firm, was planning to expand its portfolio by investing in the US cab industry. However, they wanted to make an informed decision before committing any capital. With two leading cab companies, Yellow Cab and Pink Cab, on their radar, they needed a thorough analysis of both companies' performance, profitability, customer behavior, and market trends.

## My Role and Objective

I was brought in to analyze the available data, generate insights, and ultimately recommend which company would provide the highest return on investment. My goal was to help XYZ answer critical business questions like:

*Which company is more profitable?

* Which company has a more loyal customer base?

* What are the market trends over the years?

* Which company shows the strongest growth potential?
  
This repo answers these questions and performs a thorough data analysis to guide business decisions.
